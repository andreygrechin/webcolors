# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest released version is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please, use GitHub issues to report a vulnerability. I maintain this project in
my spare time, so expect extra time to get a response. I reserve the right to
abandon any security fixes requests. If so, I will keep the issue is open.
