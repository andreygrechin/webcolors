        This is a sample containerized web application that displays one page
        with a colored background. A color can be specified in a few ways,
        in order of priority:

            1. As a command line argument `--color`.
            2. As an environment variable `COLOR`.
            3. If none of the above then the gray color will be used.

        Supported colors: {supported_colors}
        Also you may choose a `random` as an option.

        For debug use `--debug` flag.

        To open the page from docker container, use: open
            http://${host}:${port}/
